<h1>About $course_title$ </h1>
<p>
This one semester course is an introduction to the methods, the vocabulary, and
a small fragment of the subject matter of Philosophy. We will ask difficult
questions like: 
</p>
<ol>
    <li> Is there a God? </li>
    <li>Are we free?</li>
    <li>How should we reason? How should we come to believe things?</li>
    <li>What kind of life is moral? What kind of life is good? </li>
</ol>
<p>
and familiarize ourselves with some of the approaches that philosophers of
different historical periods have taken to justifying their answers to such
questions. By the end of the semester, you should expect (1) to know more
about what a few philosophers have said about these weighty matters, (2) to
better appreciate the challenges these questions present to all of us, and (3)
to have acquired a few versatile tools for thinking clearly about such
questions (and, incidentally, for thinking clearly about everything else as
well).
