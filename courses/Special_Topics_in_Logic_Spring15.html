<h1>About This Course</h1>
<p>
This course is an advanced seminar on philosophical logic. This semester, our
topic will be modal logic: the study of systems of logic that incorporate
<em>modal operators</em>, and which are used to study <em>intentional
contexts</em>, contexts in which co-referential terms, or sentences with the
same truth values, cannot be substituted <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salva_veritate">&ldquo;salva veritate&rdquo;</a>.
</p>
<p>
We will study a variety of increasingly sophisticated systems of natural
deduction for standard propositional, predicate, and second-order modal logics.
We'll also learn something about how modal logic can be used to illuminate both
some unusual modalities arising in natural language, like
&ldquo;actually&rdquo; and &ldquo;provably&rdquo;, and semantic phenomena like
rigid designation.
</p>
<p>
Time permitting, we will begin to study the semantics for these deductive
systems, and to explore some of the connections between modal logic and
other areas of philosophy and mathematics.
