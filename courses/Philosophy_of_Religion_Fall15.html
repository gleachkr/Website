    <h1>About this course</h1>
    <p>
    This course will offer a historically-oriented survey of some main
    themes in the philosophy of western religion. By reading and discussing 
    foundational works in this tradition, alongside modern-day commentary and
    development of similar ideas, we will aim to achieve a better understanding of
    how philosophy has influenced religious thought in the west, and what
    philosophy can contribute to the rational formation of beliefs about the
    extra-mundane. Among the topics we may consider are: the problem of evil,
    fatalism and divine foreknowledge, faith and the ethics of belief, the
    classical arguments for the existence of God, and the relation between
    religious and ethical belief.
