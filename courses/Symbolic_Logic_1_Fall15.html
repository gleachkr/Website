<h1>About This Course</h1>
<p>This course is an introduction to the methods of formal logic:
techniques developed by philosophers and mathematicians for determining what
follows from what. We will be concerned, in particular, with two fundamental
systems of logic known respectively as the <em>Propositional Calculus</em> and the
<em>Predicate Calculus</em>. Each of these systems consists of a simple artificial
language and an equally simple set of rules for reasoning within that language. </p>
