This course will offer a historically-oriented survey of some main
themes in the philosophy of western religion. By reading and discussing
foundational works in this tradition, alongside modern-day commentary and
development of similar ideas, we will aim to achieve a better understanding of
how philosophy has influenced religious thought in the west, and what
philosophy can contribute to the rational formation of beliefs about the
extra-mundane. Among the topics we may consider are: the problem of evil,
fatalism and divine foreknowledge, faith and the ethics of belief, the
classical arguments for the existence of God, and the relation between
religious and ethical belief.

This semester, we will aim 

1. To achieve a better understanding of the phenomenon of religious belief and
   practice;
2. to improve our core philosophical skills: the analysis (by means of
   careful reading and discussion) and synthesis (by means of careful writing
   and presentation) of concepts and arguments; and
3. to learn more about the history of the philosophy of religion in the
   west---in particular, to familiarize ourselves with some of the most
   influential works of the last few thousand years within that tradition.

By the end of the semester, you can expect to have made significant progress
towards each of these goals

#Assignments
##Textbooks

This course will use two textbooks:

1. *Readings in the Philosophy of Religion: Ancient to Contemporary* edited by
   Linda Zagzebski and Timothy D. Miller.

2. *Philosophy of Religion: an Historical Introduction* by Linda Zagzebski.

Some other readings will be made available via KSOL.

##Homework

Your primary responsibilities for this class will be

1. to do the assigned readings;

2. to contribute to classroom discussions; and

3. to complete the major assignments described below. 

There may be some (not very difficult) quizzes, to make sure that everyone is
keeping up with the reading.

##Presentations

I ask that, at some point during the semester, you give a short presentation on 
a topic of your choosing and to lead a discussion afterwards. You will need to
clear your topic and the basic structure of your presentation with me, at least
one week before the presentation. It's best to bring me an outline even more
than one week in advance, since that will give you more time to make changes if
necessary. 

I'll make a list of suggested topics available; you can also find your own
topic. You must choose a topic and a date by October 30^th^, so
that I can be sure you'll have a chance to present.

##Papers & Exams

At the end of the semester you may either write a research paper on a topic of
your choosing, or take a cumulative final exam on the readings that we've done
during the semester, or both. 

##Grading

Your grade will be 60% participation and preparedness. This part of your grade
includes the grades you receive on any in-class quizzes that we do. 15% of
your grade will come from your in-class presentation. The remaining 25% will
come from your final exam and/or final paper.

#Expectations 
##Preparation

Because this is an upper-level philosophy course, you will be asked to read
a fair amount before almost every class meeting. You will need to do this
reading in order to participate in discussions and in order to have intelligent
things to say. Reading is not optional.

You should read actively, with discussion in mind---keep a mental list (or use
pen and paper!) of the parts of the text that you agree with, or disagree
with. Scribble in the margins, even if it's just a question mark or a little
face-palm doodle when when something seems off.

##Attendance 

You may miss two classes without penalty. The two excused absences are intended
to cover things like unexpected illness and family emergencies. If you miss
more than two classes, without explicit permission given *prior* to the
absence, then I will lower your discussion grade. The lower grade is because
you've done less work than everyone else---you've contributed less to class
discussions. You can't retroactively contribute to a discussion that has
passed, so this work cannot be made up.

##Submission

You should email completed work to me at my university email address,
[gleachkr@ksu.edu](mailto:gleachkr@ksu.edu). 

I'll give suggested assignment  length by word count, so you may use whatever
font or or line-spacing you like best. I prefer, though, document formats that
I can comment on directly. If you send me a document in `.doc` or `.docx`,
I won't return it to you in the same format, and any detailed formatting be
lost. I strongly prefer `.pdf`,`.rtf`, or even plain-text.

Citations can be in any style that you like (MLA, Chicago, etc.), so long as
you are consistent, and include enough information to allow me to track down
your source. Observe a scorched-earth citation policy: cite whenever possible.

##Disabilities

K-State's disabilities policy is as follows:

>   Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations,
>   access to technology, or information about emergency
>   building/campus evacuation processes should contact the [Student
>   Access Center](http://www.k-state.edu/accesscenter/) and/or their
>   [instructor](mailto:gleachkr@ksu.edu). Services are available to
>   students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not
>   limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning
>   disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety.
>   If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the
>   Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center
>   at [accesscenter@k-state.edu]( mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu ),
>   785-532-6441; for Salina campus, contact the Academic and Career
>   Advising Center at [ acac@k-state.edu ]( mailto:acac@k-state.edu ),
>   785-826-2649.

Please don't hesitate to speak to me or to the Student Access Center if you
need any kind of accommodation.

##Honesty

The following official statement applies:

>   Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal
>   integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in
>   academic matters, one's work is performed honestly and without
>   unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by
>   registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor System.
>   The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full
>   and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate
>   courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. The
>   honor system website can be reached via the following URL:
>   [www.k-state.edu/honor](http://www.k-state.edu/honor). A component vital
>   to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which
>   applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work
>   undertaken by students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not
>   it is stated: "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor
>   received unauthorized aid on this academic work." A grade of XF can
>   result from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in
>   the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

In cases of intentional academic dishonesty, I will give an XF grade.
