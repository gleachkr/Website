This one semester course is an introduction to the history of western
philosophy. The time period covered will begin slightly before the classical
period in Greece, and will end with the crisis of the Enlightenment, around
1780 AD.

Because we cannot cover everything, we will emphasize especially 

1. Epistemology: the evolving understanding of truth, proof and evidence during
   the periods that we study.
2. The Philosophy of Religion: how philosophers justified, analyzed, and
   criticised religious belief, and how philosophical doctrines informed the
   work of influential religious thinkers.
3. Ethics: how we've arrived at some of the core ethical concepts---virtue, the
   good life, the will, and the social contract---that are still the foundation
   of ethical reflection today.

As we study these topics, we will strive to understand not just the
theories and arguments contained in the philosophical texts we read, but also
the relationship between those texts and the practical questions (particularly
about political and social justice, religious belief, and scientific method)
that confronted their authors.

By the end of the semester, you should expect (1) to know more about what
a few philosophers have said about the topics listed above (2) to better
understand "how we got to today"---how our common sense and basic intuitions
depend on the path through history that happens to lead up to the present
moment and (3) to have faced and overcome significant challenges, and as a
result, to have grown as a reader, a writer, and a philosopher.

#Classroom Expectations and Policies

##Books and Materials 

The main textbook for this class is Kenny's *A New History of Western
Philosophy*. This book should be available at the campus bookstore, and you can
also find it for a reasonable price on, for example, Amazon.com. We will also
read a large number of (translations of) primary texts.[^1] The primary texts
we're reading available for you to download through [canvas]. You should print
them out. You should also get a three ring binder, or a large folder. You
should keep the readings in the binder, so that they're there when you need
them, and so that you don't lose anything.

[^1]: a primary text is an original historical source. A secondary text is
something like our textbook, which is *about* original sources.

If you don't have a printer, you can use the printers that the university
provides at Hale Library. Instructions on how to use the library printers are
available by following this link:
<http://www.lib.k-state.edu/faq/printing-how-do-i-print-library>. The
university gives you ten dollars worth of free printing. If you need more
printing, you can add to your reserves at the ID center in the student union,
or online at <http://ksu.managemyid.com>. 

##Preparation

You'll be expected to have completed the assigned reading before each class
meeting. It's in the nature of a class like this that you're going to have to
read a fair amount---up to thirty or fourty pages per class period. Some of
what we read will be material from the textbook, and should not be too
difficult. But the primary sources we read may be genuinely challenging. 

There are many reasons why reading historical philosophical texts is hard. The
most obvious is that there is we are separated from the authors of these texts
by time, language, and culture. We need to make an effort if we are going to
get across that gap. Reading original texts is also hard because the ideas they
contain are very new to the authors. They are expressed in a raw and
unpolished way and they do not have the comforting feeling of obviousness 
that philosophical ideas acquire once they make their way into common sense and
are worn smooth by history.

You should read *carefully*. When you don't understand what the author is
saying, try to figure out what's puzzling you.  When you do understand what the
author is saying, try to think about why he or she is saying that, and whether
you agree with what's being said (and why or why not!). Careful reading will be
richly rewarded. You'll find that you have good questions for discussion, and
intelligent things to say when you're asked to say what you think about the
topic and why. Careless reading wastes everyone's time, especially yours.

Here are some tips on how to read carefully.

#. Be active. Don't just let the words wash over you. Underline the parts that
you think are important. Write questions you have in the margins of what
you're reading. Take notes, if you can, and try to put the difficult parts in
your own words.
#. Evaluate what you read. Think about what you're being told, and ask
yourself "do I want to add that to the list of things I believe?". It's a
good sign if you find yourself writing things like "Yes!" or, "This
seems wrong" in the margins.
#. Go slowly. *Careful reading takes time.* 

##Conduct

###Classroom

In the classroom, I expect you to be respectful of others. This doesn't mean
never objecting to or disagreeing with what other people says. But it means
keeping the focus on ideas, rather than on the people who are putting the
ideas forward. It should go without saying that any kind of language or
activity that threatens or demeans another person---in particular, any racist,
sexist, or homophobic language, or its equivalent---will not be tolerated.

###Email

I'm most likely to respond quickly if an email is clearly worded and organized.
The best way to organize your email is to begin with a salutation (like "Hi
Graham"), to end with a signature (like "Cheers, ---Megan Zellner"), and to have the
first line of your email say what the subject of your email is (for example,
it might say "I have three questions").

I'll respond most quickly to specific questions about class material. For
example, if you write to ask "What does Descartes mean when he uses the word
'extension' on the first page of the reading?", then you can pretty much be
sure that I will write back to you within twenty-four hours. If you ask me a
question that's not very specific (like "What is Descartes talking about in
the first meditation?"), or if you don't ask a question at all (for example if
you say "I have some questions about Descartes' first meditation", and then
don't say what those questions are), then it may be a while before I'm able to
get back to you.

If you ask a question which can be answered by looking at the syllabus, or at
the K-State website, I'll try to point you in the right direction, but I'll
expect you to figure out the answer yourself.

##Participation

It is important to participate, and I'll base your grade partly on how much I
think you've engaged with the class and the material we discuss. But there are
many ways of participating. 

You can participate by 

1. asking questions in class, or by answering them;
2. being active on the [class wiki][Class Wiki], either by doing some original
   philosophizing in the discussion sections or by working to edit, improve,
   and interlink the work of others.
3. otherwise evidencing thought, understanding, and curiosity related to
   class---for example by talking to me outside of class (I'll usually be at
   the department Tea, Thursdays at 4), by organizing a reading group, by
   incorporating what you've learned into other parts of your life. So long as
   you let me know what you're doing, any or all of these things would prove to
   me that you are not a cleverly disguised rutabaga.

##Submitting Material 

Written work should be submitted on [Canvas] by *5pm on the day that
it is due*.

Late assignments will lose $5\%$ (about a half letter grade) with each
deadline, with a new deadline beginning every 24 hours.  So, for example, if
you turn in an assignment that would have earned 85 points 25 hours late, you'll
get 75 points on that assignment, since you lost $5\%$ for missing the first
deadline, and another $5\%$ for missing the deadline 24 hours after that.

##Disabilities 

If you need an accommodation because of the effects of a disability, you can
contact me privately. Please also contact the Student Access Center, as the
official K-State statement recommends: 

> Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to
technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation
processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.
Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities
including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions,
learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If
you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or
Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at
<accesscenter@k-state.edu>, 785-532-6441; for Salina campus, contact the
Academic and Career Advising Center at <acac@k-state.edu>, 785-826-2649.

##Plagiarism 

If you plagiarize anything, I will fail you---you'll receive a grade of XF for
the course. You'll also be required to take the K-State Development and
Integrity Course. Completing this course will remove the X from your record,
but not the F. This penalty is explained in K-State's official statement on
academic honesty.

>Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which
is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, oneâ€™s work
is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and
graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the
Honor System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all
full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses
on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. The honor system website can
be reached via the following URL: <http://www.k-state.edu/honor> A component
vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies
to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students.
The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a
student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic
work." A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F
indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge
violation.

The basic idea behind plagiarism is that it is a kind of lying, where the lie
is caused either by carelessness or by a deliberate intent to mislead. What
makes it plagiarism is that you're lying, intensionally or unintentionally,
about the source of an idea. It doesn't matter if you put those ideas in your
own words. If they're not your ideas, and you allow someone to get the
impression that they are, that's plagiarism.

The way to avoid plagiarism is to make sure that your readers know where ideas
come from. If you got an idea from a friend, cite the conversation. If you got
an idea from a website, cite the website. Research is great---but *research
without citation is plagiarism*. 

For more information about how to avoid plagiarism, you can consult [K-State's
Student Tips Website](http://www.k-state.edu/honor/student/), [The Harvard
Guide to Using
Sources](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&pageid=icb.page342054),
or the wiki's sections on
[plagiarism](http://104.236.22.54/index.php/Plagiarism) and on [proper
citation](http://104.236.22.54/index.php/Proper_citation).

##Electronics

Phones, laptops, and other electronics don't work well in a discussion
setting. So, I'll ask you not to use them. If you use your phone (or laptop,
or tablet) in class, I'll ask you to put it away. If I need to ask you to put
away a phone, laptop or tablet after the first two weeks of class, you'll lose
one quiz worth of credit for each time you need to be asked.

If using a laptop is an absolutely crucial part of your note-taking, then come
and speak to me during office hours about an exception. But make sure to get
approval *before* using your laptop---otherwise the previous paragraph still
applies.

#Assignments and Grading

Grades will be based on your participation, your work on the class wiki, and on
a midterm and final exam.

##Class Wiki

As part of your work for the class, you will contribute two pages to the class
wiki---a smaller version of wikipedia that we're going to be using to share our
notes and thoughts as we work through the class. 

You'll also be doing two types of editing for the wiki. First of all, you'll be
the designated editor for a certain pair of pages on the class wiki. As an
designated editor, you'll be responsible for working with the author of those
pages to ensure their quality. 

Second of all, I'll ask you to keep an eye on the wiki, and try to find places
where the quality of the pages could be improved (by adding a link to another
page, by improving the writing mechanics, or by adding a discussion of some
important part of the topic). You should ask the author and editor of the page
you want to change to approve your proposed changes, and then you should go
ahead and make the changes. 

I'll expect you to make several edits of this kind during the semester---a
large number of small edits (say, 10 or 15 improvements to the mechanics of
separate pages) or a smaller number of large edits (say, three new sections
added to separate pages). If you make an unusually large number of edits,
relative to the average for the class, this will count positively towards your
participation grade. If you make fewer edits than I expect, then this will
count negatively towards your Wiki grade.

There will be four main due-dates for your contributions to the wiki: February
12th, March 11th, April 8th, and May 6th. Two of those will apply to you as an
author, and two of those will apply to you as an designated editor. Your other
edits can take place at any time. Because you are working with someone else,
you'll need to start well ahead of time.

For more information about the responsibilities of authors and editors, you can
consult the wiki page on [Authors and Editors](http://104.236.22.54/index.php/Authors_and_editors)

##Exams 

The midterm and the final exam will both ask you to answer questions about the
views of various figures from the history of philosophy, to define or explain
some of the concepts that we've encounter, and to reconstruct important
arguments from passages of text (which you will have seen before, and which
will be made available during the exam). 

The Midterm will take place about halfway through the semester, on \$midterm\$.
The final exam date is \$final_exam\$.

##Evaluation

Your work will be evaluated entirely on the basis of its quality. Good work is
clear, thoughtful, and free from factual or logical error. In particular, you
will need to write grammatical sentences, spell words correctly, and organize
your thoughts. You should not repeat clichÃ©s, or say things that you don't
really mean. You should make sure you know what you want to say before you
start writing. Don't say anything that's obviously false.

##Grades

<div class="table2">

--------------- ---- ------------ -----
  Participation 30\%         Wiki 40\%
        Midterm 10\%        Final 20\%
--------------- ---- ------------ -----

</div>

Your final grade is calculated according to the weights given in the table
above. $30\%$ of your grade will be based on your participation, and $70\%$
will be based on your quizzes, exams, and contributions to the Wiki. Once the
final percent score has been calculated, it will be converted into a letter
grade with percentages 100-90 an A, 89-80 a B, and so on. K-State doesn't give
pluses or minuses, but I'll round up fractions.

If you ever need clarification about the reasoning behind a particular grade,
I encourage you to contact me. I'll never lower your grade as the result of
reexamining an assignment and if you give me reason to believe that I
undervalued your work, I'll correct my mistake immediately. I ask only that
before coming in to speak with me, you send me a short ($\approx$ 1 page)
written explanation of your question or explanation of why you think your
work deserves a better grade than the one I gave it. If you think I missed
your point, try to explain that point again or indicate exactly what I
misinterpreted. If you think that I'm missing a reasonable interpretation of a
piece of text, include the text and show me what I've got wrong.

Having something specific written down makes it much easier for me to answer
your question or to see where I may have gone wrong in evaluating your work.
And, in philosophy as elsewhere, sometimes just carefully articulating a
question is nine-tenths of arriving at the answer. You may discover that you
don't need me for that final tenth.

##Late Assignments

Assignments are due by 5pm on their due date. If an assignment is late in
reaching me, or in reaching your partner for working on a given page, I'll
subtract 5\% from your grade for that assignment for each 24 hour period that
it is late---so an assignment that is one hour late will lose 5\%, and an
assignment that is 25 hours late will lose 10\%.
