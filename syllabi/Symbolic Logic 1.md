  [Graham Leach-Krouse]: mailto:gleachkr@ksu.edu

This course is an introduction to the methods of formal logic:
techniques developed by philosophers and mathematicians for determining what
follows from what. We will be concerned, in particular, with two fundamental
systems of logic known respectively as the *Propositional Calculus* and the
*Predicate Calculus*. Each of these systems consists of a simple artificial
language and an equally simple set of rules for reasoning within that language. 

If you complete this course, then by the end of the semester you should expect:

1.  to be able to use *the method of truth tables* to determine whether one
    sentence of the propositional calculus follows from another;
2.  to be able to construct a *deduction* in the propositional or predicate
    calculus, to efficiently establish that one sentence follows from another;
    and
3.  to be able to "formalize" English arguments, by translating them into one
    of our artificial languages, and in this way to use truth tables and
    deductions to uncover the logical relationships that obtain between
    sentences of English.

Each of these skills is very useful. Developing them is also good exercise. By
making a careful and deliberate use of our powers of reason, we strengthen
those powers, and ultimately learn to think more clearly about whatever
topic---logical or non-logical---that we might choose to think about.

#Assignments

Grades will be based on a combination of participation, homework (Logic 2010
assignments and optional bonus problems), occasional quizzes, two midterms, and
one final exam.

##Homework

Most of your work will be assigned and graded within the
Logic 2010 program. Assignments and due dates can be found at your
[student website](https://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu/Logic/Student/Course).
There will be a homework assignment for almost every class, so check this
website regularly. Homework will be due by midnight of the day
before the next class. So, Tuesday assignments are due by midnight Wednesday,
and Thursday assignments are due by midnight Monday.

Since the objective of these homework assignments to help you memorize the
methods that we are learning and to have them at your fingertips, you should do
them on your own, without help from friends. If you get stuck, or don't know
what to do, come see me during my office hours, or send me
[an email](mailto:gleachkr@ksu.edu).

You may also have the opportunity to do some optional "bonus" problems which
involve creative use of the techniques we're learning in class. Bonus problems
will be distributed in class.

##Exams 

There will be two in-class midterms and one final exam. These will generally be
about as hard as the exercises we've been doing. There may also be occasional
ten-minute quizzes; these will be pretty easy, but won't be announced
beforehand. The first midterm will be on September 25th. The second midterm
will be on October 30th. The time, date, and location of the final exam can be
found on the [final exam schedule](
http://courses.k-state.edu/fall2014/information/xam.html ). Our final exam is
currently scheduled for Monday, December 15th, at
9:40 AM, but this can change, so double-check.

##Grading

Your homework grades will not be posted to KSOL or Canvas. Instead, you can
find them on your student website, which you can access either by using the
Logic 2010 application, or by going directly to
[https://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu/&shy;Logic/&shy;Student/&shy;Course](
https://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu/Logic/Student/Course ).

Your grade will be 20% participation and preparedness. This part of your grade
includes the grades you receive on any in-class quizzes that we do. 40% of your
grade will be based on your homework. Each midterm will count for 10% of your
final grade, and the final exam will count for the last 20%.

<div class="table2">

     Assignment Weight
  ------------- --------
    Partipation 20%
       Homework 40%
      Midterm 1 10%
      Midterm 2 10%
     Final Exam 20%

</div>
Your final percentage score will become a letter score in the following way:
100-91 is an A, 90-81 a B, 80-71 a C, 70-61 a D, and 60 or below an F. I will
round up fractional grades.

If you ever need clarification about the reasoning behind a particular grade,
I encourage you to contact me. I'll never lower your grade as the result of
discussion, and if you give me reason to believe that I undervalued your work,
I'll correct my mistake immediately. I ask only that before coming in to speak
with me, you send me a short ($\approx$1 page) written explanation of your
question, or explanation of why you think your work deserves a better grade
than the one I gave it. If you think I missed your point, try to explain that
point again or indicate exactly what I misinterpreted. If you think that I'm
missing a reasonable interpretation of a piece of text, include the text and
show me what I've got wrong. Having something specific written down makes it
much easier for me to answer your question, or to see where I may have gone
wrong in evaluating your work.

#Expectations 
##Participation

To get the full participation grade, you'll be expected to be engaged with the
material. That means, especially, trying out your understanding by helping with
problems that we work on in class. It also means looking for clarification when
something doesn't make sense to you. You can do all that by asking questions in
class, but you can also do it by asking questions over email, or during my
office hours---any one of these things is a legitimate form of participation.

##Preparation

You *must* download and install the free software package [Logic
2010](https://logiclx.humnet.ucla.edu/). Most of the homework for the course
will be assigned and submitted in this program. If you have any trouble
installing or using the program, please [get in touch with
me](mailto:gleachkr@ksu.edu) immediately.

I'll distribute notes on the class material through the [main course
website](http://grahamlk.net/symbolic_logic_1/). You should certainly read
these. A secondary source, which some students find useful, is the free
textbook *An Exposition of Symbolic Logic* written by Terrance Parsons to
accompany the material presented in this class. This textbook is included with
the Logic 2010 software, and can be found by pressing the "text" button on that
application's main menu.

However, be careful. Reading along will not be enough to understand the
material. You will also *need* to do the exercises. This isn't something I'm
asking you to do---this is a fact of life. It is impossible to become
a champion skier by watching Olympic skiing, no matter how much you watch. It
is impossible to acquire the skills that this course is intended to impart
without a great deal of *practice*.

##Attendance 

You should come to class. If there's an in-class quiz on a day that you're not
present, you'll get a zero on that quiz. For each unexcused absence, I may
subtract as much as 3% from your participation grade.

On the first day, you will be assigned one or two study partners. If you miss class, you're responsible for getting notes from your study partners.

##Submission

Usually you will submit your work using the Logic 2010 program. You should
email completed bonus problems to me at my university email address,
[gleachkr@ksu.edu](mailto:gleachkr@ksu.edu). 

I'll give any suggested assignment length by word count, so you may use
whatever font or or line-spacing you like best. I prefer, though, document
formats that I can comment on directly. If you send me a document in `.doc` or
`.docx`, I won't return it to you in the same format, and any detailed
formatting be lost. I strongly prefer `.pdf`,`.rtf`, or even plain-text. If you have a handwritten assignment, you can scan it and email it to me. In this case, you're responsible for making sure that your work is legible. If I can't understand it, then I can't give you credit for it.

I will not accept late work, even for partial credit.

##Laptops

I'd prefer that students not use laptops, tablets, or phones during class. If
you feel as if the only way that you can take notes on the lectures is by
typing, come to speak with me, and hopefully we can work something out. After
the first few weeks of the semester, if you need to be asked to put your phone or other device away, I will subtract 1% from your participation grade.

##Disabilities

K-State's disabilities policy is as follows:

>   Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access
>   to technology, or information about emergency building/campus
>   evacuation processes should contact the [Student Access
>   Center](http://www.k-state.edu/accesscenter/) and/or their
>   [instructor](mailto:gleachkr@ksu.edu). Services are available to
>   students with a wide range of disabilities including, but not
>   limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions, learning
>   disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety.
>   If you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the
>   Manhattan or Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center
>   at [accesscenter@k-state.edu](mailto:accesscenter@k-state.edu),
>   785-532-6441; for Salina campus, contact the Academic and Career
>   Advising Center at [acac@k-state.edu](mailto:acac@k-state.edu),
>   785-826-2649.

Please don't hesitate to speak to me or to the Student Access Center if you
need any kind of accommodation.

##Honesty

The following official statement applies:

>   Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal
>   integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in
>   academic matters, one's work is performed honestly and without
>   unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and graduate students, by
>   registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor System.
>   The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full
>   and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate
>   courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. The
>   honor system website can be reached via the following URL:
>   [www.k-state.edu/honor](http://www.k-state.edu/honor). A component vital to
>   the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies
>   to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by
>   students. The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated:
>   "On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received
>   unauthorized aid on this academic work." A grade of XF can result
>   from a breach of academic honesty. The F indicates failure in the
>   course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.

In cases of intentional academic dishonesty, I will give an XF grade.

##Exceptions

I will make exceptions to the policies above only under truly exceptional circumstances. In particular, I will not make exceptions for hardships that most students suffer from (family obligations, extracurricular activities, minor illnesses, heavy academic workloads). I also will not make exceptions that alter the main requirements or basic structure of the course---I will not, for example, conduct the course over email, or exempt a student from any major assignments.

If you think your circumstances are exceptional, but do not require unreasonable accommodation, then please contact me with appropriate documentation.

##Contacting Me

You can reach me by [email](mailto:gleachkr@ksu.edu), or by coming to my office
hours, which are 4-5 on Thursday, and 10-12 on Friday. I'll also hold regular
homework labs, at a time yet to be determined.

Be careful that your emails are clear, and not too time-dependent; I can't be
sure of my ability to reply to you within 24 hours. Check the syllabus before
asking a question, to make sure the answer isn't already available to you. 
Feel free to ask philosophical questions, even if they are not directly related
to the classroom material---I'm always happy to talk about the philosophy of
logic.
