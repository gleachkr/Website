[Canvas]: \$canvas\$

This one semester course is an introduction to the methods, the vocabulary, and
a small fragment of the subject matter of Philosophy. We will ask difficult
questions like: 

1. Is there a God?
2. Are we free?
3. How should we reason? How should we come to believe things?
4. What kind of life is moral? What kind of life is good? 

and familiarize ourselves with some of the approaches that philosophers of
different historical periods have taken to justifying their answers to such
questions. By the end of the semester, you should expect (1) to know more
about what a few philosophers have said about these weighty matters, (2) to
better appreciate the challenges these questions present to all of us, and (3)
to have acquired a few versatile tools for thinking clearly about such
questions (and, incidentally, for thinking clearly about everything else as
well).

#Classroom Expectations and Policies

##Books and Materials 

You don't need to buy a book for this class. Instead, I'll make the articles
and chapters we're reading available to you through [canvas]). You should
print them out. You should also get a three ring binder, or a large folder.
You should keep the readings in the binder, so that they're there when you
need them, and so that you don't lose anything.

If you don't have a printer, you can use the printers that the university
provides at Hale Library. Instructions on how to use the library printers are
available by following this link:
<http://www.lib.k-state.edu/faq/printing-how-do-i-print-library>. The
university gives you ten dollars worth of free printing. If you need more
printing, you can add to your reserves at the ID center in the student union,
or online at <http://ksu.managemyid.com>. The total cost of printing the
readings will be less than the cost of a textbook.

##Preparation

You'll be expected to have completed the assigned reading before each class
meeting. The readings will generally be short. Easier readings might be as
long as 10 pages. More difficult readings may be as short as one or two pages.

You should read *carefully*. When you don't understand what the author is
saying, try to figure out what's puzzling you.  When you do understand what the
author is saying, try to think about why he or she is saying that, and whether
you agree with what's being said (and why or why not!). Careful reading will be
richly rewarded. You'll find that you have good questions for discussion, and
intelligent things to say when you're asked to say what you think about the
topic and why. Careless reading wastes everyone's time, especially yours.

Here are some tips on how to read carefully.

#. Be active. Don't just let the words wash over you. Underline the parts that
you think are important. Write questions you have in the margins of what
you're reading. Take notes, if you can, and try to put the difficult parts in
your own words.
#. Evaluate what you read. Think about what you're being told, and ask
yourself "do I want to add that to the list of things I believe?". It's a
good sign if you find yourself writing things like "Yes!" or, "This
seems wrong" in the margins.
#. Go slowly. *Careful reading takes time.* 

##Reading Quizzes 

After you complete each reading, you'll be asked to log on to canvas and
answer a few simple factual questions about the reading: what the reading was
about, what the author says, and so on. Sometimes, when the semester gets
busy, it can be very tempting to skip a reading and focus on other things.
These quizzes are supposed to reward you for sticking with it and doing the
reading even when there are other responsibilities you're coping with at the
same time.

##Journals

At the end of each class, I'll ask you to spend five minutes writing a short
summary of what we discussed that day in a journal, which I'll provide for
you. I'll keep your journals when we're not in class. This exercise serves
several purposes. 

First of all, trying to remember what we've done and "get the big picture" of
our topic in class on a given day is a good way to help yourself remember the
material. Second of all, by consulting your journals, I can get an idea of
what you're understanding, and what material might not have been so easy to
understand. That way, I can make sure to clarify anything that everybody found
confusing. And third, the journals help create a record of what you've learned
over the semester, which I can use when trying to figure out the degree to
which you've engaged and participated in the class.

You'll be allowed to use your journals as a resource during the midterm and
final exam, so it's a good idea to try to make your entries as clear and
systematic as you can---that way, when you're asked about something that we
discussed, you can look back on your notes and have the answer there waiting
for you.

##Conduct

###Classroom

In the classroom, I expect you to be respectful of others. This doesn't mean
never objecting to or disagreeing with what other people says. But it means
keeping the focus on ideas, rather than on the people who are putting the
ideas forward. It should go without saying that any kind of language or
activity that threatens or demeans another person---in particular, any racist,
sexist, or homophobic language, or its equivalent---will not be tolerated.

###Email

I'm most likely to respond quickly if an email is clearly worded and organized.
The best way to organize your email is to begin with a salutation (like "Hi
Graham"), to end with a signature (like "Cheers, ---Megan Zellner"), and to have the
first line of your email say what the subject of your email is (for example,
it might say "I have three questions").

I'll respond most quickly to specific questions about class material. For
example, if you write to ask "What does Descartes mean when he uses the word
'extension' on the first page of the reading?", then you can pretty much be
sure that I will write back to you within twenty-four hours. If you ask me a
question that's not very specific (like "What is Descartes talking about in
the first meditation?"), or if you don't ask a question at all (for example if
you say "I have some questions about Descartes' first meditation", and then
don't say what those questions are), then it may be a while before I'm able to
get back to you.

If you ask a question which can be answered by looking at the syllabus, or at
the K-State website, I'll try to point you in the right direction, but I'll
expect you to figure out the answer yourself.

##Attendance 

Coming to class is an important part of the work that you will do this
semester. If you miss more than one or two classes, you'll find yourself
unable to complete some required assignments, and unable to answer questions
on the midterm. If you miss more than five classes, you will lose half of your
participation grade, and if you miss more than seven, you will lose all of
your participation grade. This is true even if you have a reason (for example,
an extracurricular commitment, or another professor who has scheduled a
meeting at the same time that we are scheduled to meet) for missing
class---your participation grade is based on how much you've actually
participated, and in the same way that I can't give credit for a paper that
was never submitted (even if it was not submitted for a good reason), I can't
give credit for participation in a class that you did not attend.

##Submitting Material 

Written work should be submitted on [Canvas] by *5pm on the day that
it is due*.

Late assignments will lose $5\%$ (about a half letter grade) with each
deadline, with a new deadline beginning every 24 hours.  So, for example, if
you turn in an assignment that would have earned 85 points 25 hours late, you'll
get 75 points on that assignment, since you lost $5\%$ for missing the first
deadline, and another $5\%$ for missing the deadline 24 hours after that.

##Disabilities 

If you need an accommodation because of the effects of a disability, you can
contact me privately. Please also contact the Student Access Center, as the
official K-State statement recommends: 

> Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to
technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation
processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.
Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities
including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions,
learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If
you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or
Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at
<accesscenter@k-state.edu>, 785-532-6441; for Salina campus, contact the
Academic and Career Advising Center at <acac@k-state.edu>, 785-826-2649.

##Plagiarism 

If you plagiarize anything, I will fail you---you'll receive a grade of XF for
the course. You'll also be required to take the K-State Development and
Integrity Course. Completing this course will remove the X from your record,
but not the F. This penalty is explained in K-State's official statement on
academic honesty.

>Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which
is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one’s work
is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and
graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the
Honor System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all
full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses
on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. The honor system website can
be reached via the following URL: <http://www.k-state.edu/honor> A component
vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies
to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students.
The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a
student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic
work." A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F
indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge
violation.

The basic idea behind plagiarism is that it is a kind of lying, where the lie
is caused either by carelessness or by a deliberate intent to mislead. What
makes it plagiarism is that you're lying, intensionally or unintentionally,
about the source of an idea. It doesn't matter if you put those ideas in your
own words. If they're not your ideas, and you allow someone to get the
impression that they are, that's plagiarism.

The way to avoid plagiarism is to make sure that your readers know where ideas
come from. If you got an idea from a friend, cite the conversation. If you got
an idea from a website, cite the website. Research is great---but *research
without citation is plagiarism*. 

For more information about how to avoid plagiarism, you can consult [K-State's
Student Tips Website](http://www.k-state.edu/honor/student/), or [The Harvard
Guide to Using Sources](http://isites.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do?keyword=k70847&pageid=icb.page342054)

##Electronics

Phones, laptops, and other electronics don't work well in a discussion
setting. So, I'll ask you not to use them. If you use your phone (or laptop,
or tablet) in class, I'll ask you to put it away. If I need to ask you to put
away a phone, laptop or tablet after the first two weeks of class, you'll lose
one quiz worth of credit for each time you need to be asked.

If using a laptop is an absolutely crucial part of your note-taking, then come
and speak to me during office hours about an exception. But make sure to get
approval *before* using your laptop---otherwise the previous paragraph still
applies.

#Assignments and Grading

Grades will be based on your reading quizzes (see the section [Reading
Quizzes][]), participation, graded in class work, optional take-home
exercises, and on a midterm and final exam.

##Exercises 

Exercises may ask you to do things like formalize an argument, create a table
of some of the positions we've been discussing, or attempt to define a term.
They'll be an opportunity for you to practice skills that you've learned
during the course, and to encounter new methods that will enrich your
understanding of the material we discuss in class. They may be part of an in
class activity, or they may something that you do at home.

Exercises are optional, but will count towards the assignment portion of your
grade. The amount an exercise counts for will vary from exercise to exercise.

##Exams 

Both the midterm and the final exam will have the same format. Each one will
present you with some passages that you have read. You will need to identify
the author of each passage, the context of the passage (what piece of writing
it is a part of), and give an interpretation of the passage. The Midterm will
be about halfway through the semester, on \$midterm\$. The final exam date is
\$final_exam\$.

##Evaluation

Your work will be evaluated entirely on the basis of its quality. Good work is
clear, thoughtful, and free from factual or logical error. In particular, you
will need to write grammatical sentences, spell words correctly, and organize
your thoughts. You should not repeat clichés, or say things that you don't
really mean. You should make sure you know what you want to say before you
start writing. Don't say anything that's obviously false.

##Grades

<div class="table2">

--------------- ---- ------------ -----
   Particiation 30\%  Assignments 40\%
        Midterm 10\%        Final 20\%
--------------- ---- ------------ -----

</div>

Your final grade is calculated according to the weights given in the table
above. $30\%$ of your grade will be based on your participation, and $70\%$
will be based on your quizzes, exams, and in-class work. The optional
exercises will count towards the assignment portion of the grade, with each
exercise contributing up to $5\%$. Once the final percent score has been
calculated, it will be converted into a letter grade with percentages 100-90
an A, 89-80 a B, and so on. K-State doesn't give pluses or minuses, but I'll
round up fractions.

If you ever need clarification about the reasoning behind a particular grade, I
encourage you to contact me. I'll never lower your grade as the result of
reexamining an assignment, and if you give me reason to believe that I undervalued
your work, I'll correct my mistake immediately. I ask only that before coming in
to speak with me, you send me a short ($\approx$ 1 page) written explanation of
your question, or explanation of why you think your work deserves a better grade
than the one I gave it. If you think I missed your point, try to explain that
point again or indicate exactly what I misinterpreted. If you think that I'm
missing a reasonable interpretation of a piece of text, include the text and
show me what I've got wrong.

Having something specific written down makes it much easier for me to answer
your question, or to see where I may have gone wrong in evaluating your work.
And, in philosophy as elsewhere, sometimes just carefully articulating a
question is nine-tenths of arriving at the answer. You may discover that you
don't need me for that final tenth.

##Late Assignments

I can't accept late reading quizzes (since the reading quizzes are supposed to
encourage you to do the reading *before* class), or late optional exercises.
