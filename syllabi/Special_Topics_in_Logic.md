This course is an advanced seminar on philosophical logic. This semester, our
topic will be modal logic: the study of systems of logic that incorporate
*modal operators*, and which are used to study *intentional contexts*,
contexts in which co-referential terms, or sentences with the same truth
values, cannot be substituted "salva veritate". 

We will study a variety of increasingly sophisticated systems of natural
deduction for standard propositional, predicate, and second-order modal
logics. We'll also learn something about how modal logic can be used to
illuminate some unusual modalities arising in natural language, like
"actually" and "provably", and semantic phenomena like rigid designation. 

Time permitting, we will begin to study the semantics for these deductive
systems, and to explore some of the connections between modal logic and other
areas of philosophy and mathematics. 

#Classroom Expectations and Policies

##Books and Materials 

The textbook for this course is Gary Hardegree's [*Introduction to Modal
Logic*](<http://people.umass.edu/gmhwww/511/text.htm>)

##Preparation

You'll be expected to have completed any assigned readings before each class
meeting, and to have at least tried your hand at any assigned problems. Class
time will be devoted to clarifying difficult parts of the reading, to working
on problems and particular problem solving methods, and to discussing
applications and extensions of the material in the textbook. 

So, because we will be building on what we've read, because we will not be
devoting much class time to presenting material that's already presented in
the textbook, and because the subject matter is highly cumulative, it's very
*very* important to keep up with the reading.

##Conduct

In the classroom, I expect you to be respectful of others. This doesn't mean
never objecting or disagreeing with what someone says. But it means keeping the
focus on ideas, rather than on the people who are putting the ideas forward. It
should go without saying that any kind of language or activity that threatens
or demeans another person---in particular, any racist, sexist, or homophobic
language, or its equivalent---will not be tolerated.

##Attendance 

This will be a small seminar, and everyone is going to be expected to
contribute. That means everyone should be there for every class meeting. If
you absolutely can't make it to a class, you need to let me know beforehand,
over email, so that I can be prepared. 

##Submitting Material 

You can submit homework to me electronically by email, or in hard copy  by
hand. If you want to type up your work on a computer, I strongly recommend the
LaTeX typesetting system. It does a beautiful job of efficiently typesetting
logical symbols (and mathematical and scientific symbols generally). If you’re
considering going on to do graduate work in philosophy, science, or
mathematics, you should seriously consider learning how to use LaTeX.

[The (Not So) Short Introduction to LaTeX
2ε](http://ctan.mirrors.hoobly.com/info/lshort/english/lshort.pdf) provides a
short introduction to LaTeX. Links to installations for various operating
systems can be found at [The LaTeX Project](http://www.latex-project.org). 

##Disabilities 

If you need an accommodation because of the effects of a disability, you can
contact me privately; please also contact the Student Access Center, as the
official K-State statement recommends: 

> Students with disabilities who need classroom accommodations, access to
technology, or information about emergency building/campus evacuation
processes should contact the Student Access Center and/or their instructor.
Services are available to students with a wide range of disabilities
including, but not limited to, physical disabilities, medical conditions,
learning disabilities, attention deficit disorder, depression, and anxiety. If
you are a student enrolled in campus/online courses through the Manhattan or
Olathe campuses, contact the Student Access Center at
<accesscenter@k-state.edu>, 785-532-6441; for Salina campus, contact the
Academic and Career Advising Center at <acac@k-state.edu>, 785-826-2649.

##Plagiarism 

The following official statement applies:

>Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which
is presumed to be sufficient assurance that, in academic matters, one’s work
is performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. Undergraduate and
graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the
Honor System. The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all
full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses
on-campus, off-campus, and via distance learning. The honor system website can
be reached via the following URL: <http://www.k-state.edu/honor> A component
vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which applies
to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by students.
The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a
student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid on this academic
work." A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty. The F
indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge
violation.

#Assignments and Grading

Grades will be based on a combination of participation, homework, two
midterms, and one final exam.

##Homework

Homework assignments will ask you to solve problems and prove theorems.
Homework serves two purposes. First, it's a good diagnostic tool: it lets you
and me tell how you're doing, and what might be giving you a problem. Second,
some of the less routine problems that I assign will be a good way of learning
specific things---I'll try to pick illustrative puzzles, which lead to
particularly rewarding "ah ha!" moments.

Homework is not intended to be your only source of practice with the systems
we'll be using. An important part of your studying for the class should be
working through some of the problems in the textbook at your own pace. 

##Exams 

There will be two take-home midterms and one take-home final exam. The
midterms will be about as hard as the homework, but they’ll be cumulative,
rather than focusing on what we've been doing most recently. The final exam
will be similar, but longer.

The first midterm will be due on February 25th. The second midterm will be due
on April 8th. The official time, date, and location of the final exam can be
found on the final exam schedule; at the moment, it is listed as
\$final_exam\$. However, if you need an extension on the final exam, you're
welcome to just turn it in by the end of finals week.

##Grading

The weights of each kind of coursework in determining a final grade are given
in the following table. 

<div class="table2">

-------------------- -----
         Partipation 20\% 
            Homework 40\% 
           Midterm 1 10\% 
           Midterm 2 10\%
               Final 20\%
-------------------- -----

</div>

Your final percentage score will become a letter score in the following way:
100-91 is an A, 90-81 a B, 80-71 a C, 70-61 a D, and 60 or below an F. If you
ever need clarification about the reasoning be- hind a particular grade, I
encourage you to contact me. I'll never lower your grade as the result of
discussion, and if I've missed or misunderstood something, I’ll correct my
mistake immediately.
