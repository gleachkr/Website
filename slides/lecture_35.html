<h1>Where we are</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Every legitimate idea has its origins in experience</li>
<li>In experience, we encounter successive impressions, but we are never directly aware of a necessary connection between one experience and another.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hence, the idea of a necessary connection between ideas is empty.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Beliefs are of two kinds: those expressing a relation of ideas, and those expressing a matter of fact.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>We know about relations of ideas by proof—unpacking definitions, and using logic inferences.</p>
</div>
<div class="fragment">
<p>We know about matters of fact that we cannot directly observe by causal reasoning: infering the presence of a cause from its effects, and vice versa.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>How do we know that causal relations are present?</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Not by observing a “necessary connection” between cause and effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Must be by repeated observation.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>How do we know repeatedly observed connections will reoccur?</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Uniformity of nature.</p>
</div>
<div class="fragment">
<p>How do we know nature is uniform? Not by proving it, since the uniformity of nature is a matter of fact, not a relation of ideas.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>The universe has been pretty uniform up until now…</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>But we can’t use that observation to prove the uniformity of nature, without presupposing the uniformity of nature…</p>
</div>
</section><section id="the-skeptical-solution" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Skeptical Solution</h1>
<p>Belief in the uniformity of nature is not supported by <em>anything</em></p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Or at least not by evidence of any kind.</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Instead, it is mere <em>custom</em> that brings us to believe in it.</p>

<li>Find an alleged concept which cannot be analyzed as a copy or recombination of direct impressions in experience.</li>

<li>The conditions of experience that lead us to apply this concept.</li>
<li>The drives that explain our application in these conditions.</li>

<p>How does he do this in the case of causation?</p>

<p>Does explaining <em>why</em> someone believes something, in terms that have nothing to do with the reasons for belief, show the belief to be unjustified?</p>

<h1>The Bundle Theory</h1>
<p>We are not substances.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>We are bundles of experiences, whose parts come and go.</p>
</div>
<div class="fragment">
<p>The question of our identity over time is analogous to the question of whether material things persist through changes in composition. Like that question, it has no good answer.</p>
