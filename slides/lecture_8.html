<h1>The Charters</h1>
<p>Plato’s brothers.</p>
<p>Both fought in the Peloponnesian war.</p>
<p>Glaucon, an artist, more ambitious. Ademantus, more down to earth.</p>
</section><section id="three-classes" class="slide level2">
<h1>Three Classes</h1>

<h1>The Challenge</h1>
<p>Show Justice is doubly-desirable.</p>
<p>Glaucon’s Claim: It is extrinsically desirable</p>
</section><section id="glaucons-theory" class="slide level2">
<h1>Glaucon’s Theory</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>They say to do injustice is by nature good; to suffer injustice, evil; but that the evil is greater than the good… Hence there arise laws and mutual covenants… justice, being at a middle point between [doing harm and suffering harm] is tolerated not as a good, but as a lesser evil</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="glaucons-arguments" class="slide level2">
<h1>Glaucon’s Arguments</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Gyges Argument: Justice is involuntary. Any reasonable person who can get away with injustice will ignore justice.</p></li>
<li><p>Argument from isolation: The perfectly saint is miserable. The perfect villain lives well.</p></li>
</ol>
</section><section id="ademantus-arguments" class="slide level2">
<h1>Ademantus’ Arguments</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Parents and tutors urge justice, but for the sake, not of justice, but for the sake of the admiration and favor of others (human and divine)</p></li>
<li><p>Everyone agrees that virtue is hard and vice can be profitable—even the gods seem (and are reported) not to favor the more virtuous.</p></li>
</ol>
</section><section id="ademantus-anticipates-objections" class="slide level2">
<h1>Ademantus Anticipates objections</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You say it’ll be hard to get away with this. Fine, let’s assume we have a secret society, and that we’re very persuasive.</p></li>
<li><p>You say the gods will know. But let’s be consistent. Either we believe what the poets say about the gods, in which case we can bribe them, or we believe there are no gods, in which case no retribution.</p></li>
</ol>
</section><section id="the-revised-challenge" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Revised Challenge</h1>
<p>In order to answer the challenge, while resisting these arguments, Socrates must</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Show “The superiority of justice over injustice”</li>
<li>Show “The effect that they have on the possessor of them which makes one a good and the other an evil to [the possessor]” (this addresses Glaucon’s arguments)</li>
<li>Do so without appealing to reputation: show that justice is a good to its possessor “whether seen or unseen by gods or men”. (this addresses Ademantus’ arguments and objections)</li>
</ol>
</section></section>
<section><section id="the-just-state" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>The Just State</h1></section><section id="the-strategy" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Strategy</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>in the larger, the quantity of justice is likely to be larger and more easily discernible. I propose therefore that we enquire into the nature of justice and injustice, first as they appear in the State, and secondly in the individual</p>
</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Don’t need to take the point about size literally. It’s much easier to talk about what’s in a city than it is to talk about what’s in a person’s character.</p>
</aside>
</section><section id="the-first-city" class="slide level2">
<h1>The First City</h1>
<p>Basic social roles, farmers, traders, etc.</p>
<p>War and famine are avoided by abstaining from luxuries.</p>
<p>Justice consists “in the dealings of these citizens with one another”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In my opinion the true and healthy constitution of the state is the one which I have described.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>in a more luxurious state, we shall be more likely to see how justice and injustice originate</p>
</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Why this digression?</p>
</aside>
</section><section id="the-fevered-city" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Fevered City</h1>
<p>Add artisans, musicians, cooks, swineherds, physicians…</p>
<p>And an army (since neighboring cities will want to invade)</p>
</section><section id="the-guardians" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Guardians</h1>
<p>A group of people who are both passionate enough to defend the city, and gentle enough to be good citizens must be lovers of wisdom</p>
</section><section id="their-education" class="slide level2">
<h1>Their Education</h1>
<p>Careful censorship of fiction: only truth about the Gods.</p>
</section><section id="theological-principles" class="slide level2">
<h1>Theological Principles</h1>
<ol type="a">
<li>Gods do not quarrel</li>
<li>God is not the cause of evils (what’s the argument?)</li>
<li>God is unchanging (argument)</li>
<li>God is incapable of falsehood (argument?)</li>
</ol>
<p>Echoes of Xenophanes</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>It’s interesting to ask what to make of the numbers here. Word is “Theos”. No indefinite article in ancient Greek. Refers generally to “The Divine”, so there’s no implication of monotheism.</p>
