<p>Version one:</p>

<p>Version two:</p>

<p>Version three:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“When someone says ’I am thinking, therefore I am, or I exist”, he does not deduce something from thought by means of a syllogism, but recognizes it as self-evident by a simple intuition of the mind.&quot; (Descartes, Replies)</p>

<p>Does this mean I am an immaterial thing?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now, it is plain I am not the assemblage of members called the human body… But it is true, perhaps, that those very things which I suppose to be non-existent, because they are unknown to me, are not in truth different from myself who I know.</p>

<p>To doubt. To understand, to conceive, to affirm, to deny, to will, to refuse. To imagine, to perceive.</p>

<p>Do we now know what we are, with greater clarity than what we thought we knew before we began?</p>

<p>I cannot help believing that corporeal things, whose images are formed by thought [which fall under the senses], and are examined by the same, are known with much greater distinctness…</p>

<p>Piece of beeswax. What is it, that we perceive whenever we perceive this beeswax?</p>

<p>Something extended, flexible, movable.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>what is meant by flexible and movable? Is it not that I imagine that the piece of wax, being round, is capable of becoming square…?</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="fragment">
<blockquote>
<p>Assuredly such is not the case, because I conceive that it admits of an infinity of similar changes; and I am, moreover, unable to compass this infinity by imagination</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
<div class="fragment">
<blockquote>
<p>consequently this conception which I have of the wax is not the product of the faculty of imagination</p>
</blockquote>

</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Similarly for extension.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I must, therefore, admit that I cannot even comprehend by imagination what the piece of wax is, and that it is mind alone which perceives it.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="the-contents-of-perception" class="slide level2">
<h1>The contents of perception</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I am almost led into error by the terms of ordinary language. We say, for example, that we see the same wax when it is before us… whence I should be forthwith be disposed to conclude that the wax is known by the act of sight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But, when people pass on the street, completely bundled up, we still say we “see” the people…</p>
</section><section id="perception-requires-cognition" class="slide level2">
<h1>Perception requires cognition</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>when I distinguish the wax from its exterior forms… I cannot, nevertheless, thus apprehend it without possessing a human mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If I judge that the wax exists because I see it, it assuredly follows much more evidently that I myself am or exist.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<blockquote>
<p>bodies themselves are not properly perceived by the senses, nor by the faculty of the imagination, but by the intellect alone; and since they are not perceived because they are seen or touched, but only because they are understood, I readily discover that there is nothing more easily or clearly apprehended than my own mind.</p>
