<blockquote>
<p>[Books] are not the real preparation for living, for living is made of of things very different… [a contemplative stoic is] as if a champion, when he enters the ring, should begin crying because he is not still exercising. It was for this that you were exercised.</p>

<p>Man’s first attraction is towards the things in accordance with nature.

<aside class="notes">
<p>Virtue is the good. But we don’t choose things because they’re part of our good. We choose things because they’re in accordance with nature.</p>
<p>These things possess axia—they’re worthy of choice. There are also things that possess the opposite of this, and are worthy of rejection</p>
<p>But axia isn’t the same as real desirability. The thing that’s unconditionally desirable is choice in accordance with nature. Virtue is like dancing, or playing music, and unlike making a ship. The activity itself is the product, not what’s left behind by the activity.</p>
<p>Some things with sufficient axia are to be “preferred”</p>
<p>Even choices are among the indifferents—it’s choices <em>coming out of virtue</em> that are to be preferred, rather than just “appropriate acts”</p>

<h1>Philanthropy</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Just as the laws set safety of all above the safety of individuals, so a good, wise a law abiding man studies the advantages of all more than that of himself</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The mere fact of their common humanity requires that one man should feel another man to be akin to him</p>

<h1>Discipline</h1>
<p>Perception, and emotion, are cognitive—they’re a form of judgement.</p>
<p>False judgement is aproegmena (and willful stupidity is vicious)</p>
<p>Hence, we should quiet immoderate emotion.</p>

<h1>Against Epicurianism</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Even Epicurus is sensible that we are by nature sociable beings…why then, do you, Epicurus, dissuade a wise man from bringing up children? But Epicurus knew, that, if once a child is born, it is no longer in our power not to love and be solicitous for it.</p>

<h1>Children</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Not even a sheep or a wolf deserts its offspring; and shall man? What would you have? that we should be as silly as sheep… or as savage as wolves? For my part, I am of the opinion, that your mother and father, even if they could have forseen that you would be the author of such doctrines, would not have thrown you away.</p>
