<section><section id="philosophical-challenges-for-medieval-philosophy" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>Philosophical Challenges for Medieval Philosophy</h1></section><section id="faith-and-reason" class="slide level2">
<h1>Faith and Reason</h1>
<p>What is the relationship between philosophical investigation of the divine and the “revealed truth” given in doctrine?</p>
</section><section id="tertullian" class="slide level2">
<h1>Tertullian</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Whence spring those “fables and endless genealogies,” and “unprofitable questions,” and “words which spread like a cancer?” From all these, when the apostle would restrain us, he expressly names philosophy as that which he would have us be on our guard against…. Away with all attempts to produce a mottled Christianity of Stoic, Platonic, and dialectic composition! We want no curious disputation after possessing Christ Jesus, no inquisition after enjoying the gospel! With our faith, we desire no further belief.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="clement-of-alexandria" class="slide level2">
<h1>Clement of Alexandria</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Hellenistic philosophy … rendering powerless the assault of sophistry against [the truth] is said to be the proper “fence and wall of the vineyard”. And the truth which is according to faith is as necessary for life as bread… The thief possess really, what he has possessed himself of dishonestly… The ideas, then, which they have stolen, and which are partially true, they know by conjecture and necessary logical deduction: on becoming disciples, therefore, they will know them with intelligent apprehension.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="the-nature-of-god" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Nature of God</h1>
<p>God is supposed to be perfect. Greek Philosophers, long ago, argued that this implied:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Immutability</li>
<li>Impassibility</li>
<li>Perfect Benevolence</li>
<li>Omnipotence</li>
<li>Omniscience</li>
</ol>
<p>How can the biblical God have these traits?</p>
</section><section id="the-problem-of-evil" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Problem of Evil</h1>
<p>And are these traits even coherent?</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Christian writers contended that Epicurus had argued they were not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is God willing to prevent evil, but not able? Then he is not omnipotent. Is he able, but not willing? Then he is malevolent. Is he both able and willing? Then whence cometh evil? Is he neither able nor willing? Then why call him God?”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</section><section id="divine-foreknowledge-and-free-will" class="slide level2">
<h1>Divine Foreknowledge and Free Will</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>If God believed yesterday that you’d be sitting here today, then this morning if you were to not come to class, God would have had a false belief</li>
<li>God did believe this yesterday (omniscience)</li>
<li>It is impossible for God to have a false belief.</li>
<li>If something implies something impossible, it is impossible</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, it was impossible for you to not come to class this morning.</p>
</section><section id="conceptions-of-the-soul-and-immortality" class="slide level2">
<h1>Conceptions of the Soul and Immortality</h1>
</section><section id="platonic-dualism" class="slide level2">
<h1>Platonic Dualism</h1>
<p>Immortality of the soul, separate from the body</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[the philosopher’s soul] has escaped from the influence of pleasures and pains, which are like nails fastening her to the body. To that prison-house she will not return… she knows that only when calm and free from the dominion of the body can she behold the light of truth.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="christian-doctrine" class="slide level2">
<h1>Christian Doctrine</h1>
<p>Immortality of the body, after the general resurrection.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the holy catholic and apostolic church, the communion of saints, the forgiveness of sins, <em>the resurrection of the body</em>, and the life everlasting. Amen.</p>
