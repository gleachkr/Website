<h1>The Principles of Nature</h1>
<p>Principle: arche (ἀρχή)</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>What does this mean? Approximately, origin or source. But these words are themselves a little confused. Because, an origin can be a starting point, like a point in time. It can also be a starting point in space—you can point to the origin of a river.</p>
<p>And this isn’t a perfect translation. Because the Greek word, if we want to know what the pre-Socratics meant by it, is a little rougher and more confused than even this.</p>
<p>Basically, you can think of an arche as the basic starting point for explanation.</p>

</section><section id="material-principles" class="slide level2">
<h1>Material Principles</h1>
<p>Everything comes from material principles either by</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Condensation and Rarefaction (Thales, Heraclitus. Xenophanes, Anaxemines)</p></li>
<li><p>Separation and Mixture (Empedocles, Anaxagoras)</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes “Efficient Principles” (Empedocles’ Love and Strife, Anaxagoras’ Mind, Heraclitus’ Logos) explain change.</p>
</section><section id="ambitions" class="slide level2">
<h1>Ambitions</h1>
<p>To explain the world, in terms of what it’s made of.</p>
<p>Example: Xenophanes on clouds.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The sea is the source of water and of wind, For without the great sea, there would be no wind nor streams of rivers, nor rainwater from on high. But the great sea is the begetter of clouds, winds, and rivers.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="fragment">
<blockquote>
<p>The sort of fires that appear on ships—whom some call the Dioscuri [St. Elmo’s fire]—are tiny clouds glimmering in virtue of the sort of motion they have.</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</section><section id="systematic-understanding" class="slide level2">
<h1>Systematic Understanding</h1>
<p>As Heraclitus puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Those who would speak with understanding must ground themselves firmly in that which is common to all, just as a city does in its law, and even more firmly! For all human laws are nourished by one law, the divine; for it rules as far at it wishes and suffices for all, and is still more than enough.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="suspicion-of-the-senses" class="slide level2">
<h1>Suspicion of the Senses</h1>
<p>Heraclitus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eyes and ears are bad witnesses to those with barbarian souls.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Democritus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>By convention sweet and by convention bitter… In reality, atoms and void.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="paradoxes" class="slide level2">
<h1>Paradoxes</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Democritus and the Cone</p></li>
<li><p>Zeno and the Arrow</p></li>
<li><p>Zeno and the Millet</p></li>

<section><section id="the-melian-dialogue-vs.the-funeral-oration" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>The Melian Dialogue vs. The Funeral Oration</h1></section><section id="the-funeral-oration" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Funeral Oration</h1>
<p>Note the context. A speech given in praise of the war dead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Before</strong>: Cypress coffins are borne in cars… Among those is carried one empty bier decked for the missing.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>After</strong>: Such was the funeral… In the first days of summer, the Lacedaemonians … laid waste to the country. Not many days after … the plague first began to show itself … a pestilence of such extent and mortality was nowhere remembered.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="democratic-values" class="slide level2">
<h1>Democratic values:</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighboring states; we are rather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves… If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in their private differences</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="military-conduct." class="slide level2">
<h1>Military conduct.</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>If we turn to our military policy, there also we differ from antagonists. We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien acts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing, although the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our liberality</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>it is only the Athenians who, fearless of consequences, confer their benefits not from calculations of expediency, but in the confidence of liberality.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="the-melian-dialogue" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Melian Dialogue</h1>
<p>Cut-throat Political Realism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>we both alike know that into the discussion of human affairs, justice only enters where there is equal power to enforce it, and that the powerful exact what then can, and that the weak suffer what they must.</p>
</blockquote>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Various practical arguments are offered, in a tone of increasing desperation</p>
</aside>
<div class="fragment">
<p>This is elevated to a kind of moral rule:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>of Gods we believe, and of men we know, that by a law of their nature, wherever they can rule they will</p>
