<aside class="notes">
<p>Hi everyone, and welcome to the history of philosophy. I’ve been looking forward to teaching this class for a long time. I’m going to try to do some new, very geeky, things this semester, and I’m extremely excited to share them with you.</p>
<p>Here’s the basic information for this class. My name is Graham, and you can call me by my name. I already know some of you. I hope that I’ll be getting to know the rest of you better as the semester goes on.</p>
<p>The location for this class is Seaton hall, 161. This is a different location from what was originally planned, but we turned out to have many more students than we originally planned. So, we’ll see how it goes.</p>
<p>We’re going to be doing some collaborative work online. And I’m going to be sharing my slides with you all. Unfortunately, Canvas is very limiting, and I’m one of those annoying people who likes to fuss around with every detail, so we’re not going to be using canvas for those things—instead, you’ll be able to access the course materials on the course website, at the URL listed above.</p>
<p>I will distribute readings via canvas, and I may use it for a few other things, but the main site you’ll need to pay attention to is the one above.</p>

<h1>History of Philosophy?</h1>
<aside class="notes">
<p>The title of this course is impossibly broad.</p>
<p>Philosophy is something that takes place all over the world. I tend to think that philosophy isn’t very different from the ordinary process of just trying to think consistently and in a way that makes sense, while still getting by in the world. So this is like teaching “History of War”, or “History of Food”.</p>
<p>The records we have of human philosophical activity go back literally thousands of years. We can’t hope to cover it all.</p>

<h1>History of Western Philosophy?</h1>
<aside class="notes">
<p>So, I’ve had to make some hard choices. First of all, we’re only focusing on western philosophy. Don’t make the mistake of thinking that there isn’t profound philosophy to be found outside of the west, or of thinking that for example</p>

<h1>To Steal All The Good Ideas</h1>
<p>True, we’ve learned a lot since Plato.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>But there are some things Plato (and others) said that haven’t yet been said better.</p>

<h1>To Learn From the Masters</h1>
<p>You might have a good friend, who you disagree with about many things.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>You might still learn from this friend—not by believing what she believes, but by watching how she thinks.</p>

<h1>To Better Understand Ourselves</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Even the most practical man of affairs is usually in the thrall of some long dead economist</p>
<p>—John Maynard Keynes, <br> long-dead economist</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="fragment">
<p>This is doubly true if you substitute “philosopher” for “economist”.</p>
