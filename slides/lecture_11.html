<h1>The Waves</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>It’s absurd that women should play the same roles as men.</li>

<li>This city can never be realized.</li>

<p>1,2 are well worth reading. But let’s focus on 3.</p>
</section><section id="the-city-is-impossible" class="slide level2">
<h1>The City is Impossible</h1>
<p>Replies:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This is no objection. We’re trying to see what an ideal state would be like, not how to construct such a state.</p></li>
<li><p>And, furthermore, we can at least think of conditions under which an ideal state would come to be.</p></li>
</ol>
</section><section id="when-philosophers-are-kings" class="slide level2">
<h1>When Philosophers are Kings</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Until Philosophers are Kings, or the kings and princes of the world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either to the exclusion of the other compelled to stand aside, cities will never have rest from their evils… then only will our State have a possibility of life and behold the light of day</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="is-this-a-power-grab" class="slide level2">
<h1>Is This a Power Grab?</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Socrates insists that most people who call themselves philosophers aren’t suitable for rule. The right person will have political greatness and <em>genuine</em> wisdom.</li>
</ol>
<div class="fragment">
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>Think here of what happened to Socrates.</p>
<p>Plato’s argument feels different when you imagine that he want to put his murdered friend, not himself, on the throne.</p></li>

</section><section id="how-is-this-justified" class="slide level2">
<h1>How is this Justified?</h1>
<p>Let’s start from definitions.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>What is a philosopher?</p>
</div>
</section></section>
<section><section id="defining-the-philosopher" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>Defining the Philosopher</h1></section><section id="lovers-of-wisdom" class="slide level2">
<h1>Lovers of Wisdom?</h1>
<p>The starting point—those who desire to know.</p>
</section><section id="the-curious" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Curious?</h1>
<p>Glaucon:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If curiosity makes a philosopher, you will find many a strange being who will have a title to the name.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Challenge: This definition is not extensionally adequate.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Reply: let’s be more specific about “know”</p>
</div>
</section><section id="the-two-faculties" class="slide level2">
<h1>The two faculties</h1>
<p>Premises:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Knowledge is directed towards what is</li>
<li>Ignorance is directed towards what is not</li>
<li>Opinion, knowledge (and ignorance) are different faculties</li>
<li>Different faculties have different subject matters</li>
</ol>
<p>Therefore, opinion is neither about what is, nor what is not.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Plausibility?</p>
</div>
</section><section id="the-subject-of-opinion" class="slide level2">
<h1>The subject of opinion</h1>
<p>Opinion concerns what neither altogether is one thing (beautiful, just, good, holy, equal, round, square…) nor altogether not.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Claim: which is pretty much everything.</p>
</div>
</section><section id="against-the-curious" class="slide level2">
<h1>Against the Curious</h1>
<p>The curious are those who love this kind of opinion.</p>
<p>The lovers of wisdom are those who want knowledge of what is: the pure instances, or templates, or forms of various things</p>
</section></section>
<section><section id="why-philosophers" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>Why Philosophers?</h1></section><section id="section-1" class="slide level2">
<h1></h1>
<p>Now that we’ve got a definition, why let them rule?</p>
</section><section id="two-main-arguments" class="slide level2">
<h1>Two Main Arguments</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Mending the world:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge of the true being of each thing… [who] are unable as with a painters eye to look at the absolute truth and to that original to repair… and order the laws about beauty, goodness, justice… are not such persons, I ask, simply blind?</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>From traits: essentially, Philosophers will have many good qualities as a result of their relationship to truth.</p></li>
</ol>
</section><section id="the-ship-of-state" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Ship of State</h1>
<p>The captain of the mutiny?</p>
<p>Or the pilot?</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>Implicit criticism of democracy here. This is a kind of challenge, one that a defender of democracy needs to answer. Why <em>do</em> we choose our leaders in the way we do?</p>
</aside>
</section></section>
<section><section id="the-highest-knowledge" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>The Highest Knowledge</h1></section><section id="section-2" class="slide level2">
<h1></h1>
<p>Why does the knowledge of the guardians qualify them for rule, and make them analogous to the pilot? They’re not technical experts, like the cobbler or the shipbuilder.</p>
<p>What, in more detail, is the sort of thing that the guardians will know?</p>
</section><section id="the-good" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Good</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>That without which, any other knowledge or possession of any kind will profit us nothing.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What is the good?</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Not pleasures, since there are bad pleasures and good.</li>
<li>Not knowledge, since it’s only valuable (good) pieces of knowledge that’s are worth having.</li>
</ol>
</section><section id="defining-the-good" class="slide level2">
<h1>Defining the Good</h1>
<p>By Analogy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The many, as we say, are seen but not known, and the ideas are known but not seen</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not literal sight—that’s the analogy</p>
<aside class="notes">
<p>There’s a kind of tradition—and we’re going to be talking about this more over the semester—that this is the best you can do when it comes to certain things. One suspects that Plato is an early exemplar of this tradition.</p>
</aside>
<blockquote>
<p>Without the addition of some other nature, there is no seeing or being seen</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="the-analogy-to-light" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Analogy to Light</h1>
<p>The sun (the child of the good) is to the faculty of sight, as the good is to the faculty of knowledge</p>
<blockquote>
<p>when resting upon that on which truth and being shine, the soul perceives and understands, and is radiant with intelligence; but when turned towards the twilight of becoming and perishing, then she has opinion only, and goes blinking about, and is first of one opinion and then of another</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="the-divided-line" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Divided Line</h1>
<p>Reflections - The Reflected - The Hypothetical - First Principles</p>
</section><section id="geometry" class="slide level2">
<h1>Geometry</h1>
<p>In Geometry</p>
<blockquote>
<p>there are their hypotheses, which they and everyone else are supposed to know, and they do not deign to give any account of them either to themselves or others… but they begin with them, and go on until they arrive, at last, and in a consistent manner, at their conclusion</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="dialectic" class="slide level2">
<h1>Dialectic</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>using hypotheses not as first principles, but only as hypotheses—that is to say, steps and points of departure into a world above hypotheses… the first principles of the whole.</p>
