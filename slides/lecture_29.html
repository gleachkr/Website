<h1>The Problem</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>the primary notions of things which the mind readily and passively imbibes, stores up, and accumulates (and it is from them that all the rest flow) are false, confused, and overhastily abstracted from the facts; nor are the second and subsequent notions less arbitrary and inconsistent</p>

<blockquote>
<p>From which it follows that the entire fabric of human reason which we employ in the inquisition of nature is badly put together and built up, like some magnificent structure without any foundation.</p>

<h1>The Solution</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>there was but one course left, therefore,—to try the whole thing anew upon a better plan, and to commence a total reconstruction of sciences, arts, and all human knowledge, raised upon the proper foundations.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>when men sailed only by observation of stars, they could indeed coast along the shores of the old continent or cross a few and small Mediterranean seas; but before the ocean could be traversed, the use of the mariners needle… had to be found out… before we can reach the remoter and more hidden parts of nature, it is necessary that a more perfect use and application of the human mind and intellect be introduced.</p>

<p>Intrinsic faults of the human understanding.</p>

<p>It is a false assertion that the sense of man is the measure of things. On the contrary, all perceptions, as well as the sense of the mind, are according to the measure of the individual and not according to the measure of the universe.</p>

<p>I am now therefore to speak touching hope… For without it the rest tends rather to make men sad (by giving them a worse and meaner opinion of how things as they are than they have now, and making them more fully to feel and know the unhappiness of their own condition)</p>
