<p>the diversity of our opinions does not arise from some being endowed with a larger share of reason than others, but solely from this, that we conduct our thoughts along different ways, and do not fix our attention on the same objects.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[upon completing my education] I found myself involved in so many doubts and errors, that I was convinced I had advanced no farther in all my attempts at learning, than the discovery at every turn of my own ignorance… I knew the judgement others had formed of me; and I did not find that I was considered inferior to my fellows… I was thus led to the liberty of judging all men as myself.</p>

<h1>Foundations</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I compared the disquisitions of the ancient Moralists to very towering and magnificent palaces with no better foundation than sand and mud.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>As to the other Sciences, inasmuch as these borrow their principles from philosophy, I judged that no solid superstructures could be reared on foundations so infirm</p>

<p>I should find more truth in the reasonings of each individual with reference to the affairs in which he is personally interested, and the issue of which must presently punish him if he is judged amiss, than in those conducted by a man of letters in his study</p>

<p>all things, to the knowledge of which man is competent, are mutually connected in the same way, and that there is nothing so far removed from us as to be beyond our reach, or so hidden that we cannot discover it, provided only we abstain from accepting the false for the true, and always preserve in our thoughts the order necessary for the deduction of one truth from another.</p>
