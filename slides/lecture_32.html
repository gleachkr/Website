<section><section id="descartes-and-the-idea-of-god" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>Descartes and the Idea of God</h1></section><section id="where-are-we" class="slide level2">
<h1>Where are we?</h1>
<p>Descartes has introduced</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The Method of Doubt</li>
<li>The Cartesian Demon</li>
<li>The Cogito</li>
<li>The Cartesian Analysis of the Self</li>
</ol>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So we know that we exist, and we know some things about our attributes.</p>
</section><section id="clear-and-distinct-ideas" class="slide level2">
<h1>Clear and Distinct Ideas</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>“In this first knowledge, there is nothing that gives me assurance of its truth except the clear and distinct perception of what I affirm, which would not give me the assurance that what I say is true, if it could ever happen that anything I thus clearly and distinctly perceived should prove false.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<blockquote>
<p>accordingly, it seems to me that I may take it as a general rule, that all that is very clearly and distinctly apprehended is true.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>So do we have a clear and distinct perception that things exist outside of us?</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>It kind of <em>seems</em> like they exist outside of us. Why?</p>
</div>
<div class="fragment">
<ol type="1">
<li>“It seems I am so taught by nature”</li>
<li>“I am conscious that (My sensations seemingly of objects) are not dependent on my will… And it is very reasonable to suppose that this object impresses me with its own likeness”</li>
</ol>
</div>
</section><section id="the-natural-light" class="slide level2">
<h1>The Natural Light</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>what the natural light shows to be true can be in no degree doubtful, as for example, that I am because I doubt, and other truths of the like kind; inasmuch as I possess no other faculty whereby to distinguish truth from error, which can teach me the falsity of what the natural light declares to be true, and which is equally trustworthy</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Is every natural impulse to believe a deliverance of the natural light, in this sense?</p>
</section><section id="independence-of-the-will" class="slide level2">
<h1>Independence of the Will</h1>
<p>Does the fact that an idea or mental event is independent of our will mean that it originates in something outside of us?</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Do our ideas of things necessarily resemble the things themselves?</p>
</section></section>
<section><section id="descartes-ontological-argument" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>Descartes’ Ontological Argument</h1></section><section id="why" class="slide level2">
<h1>Why?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>God might perhaps have given me such a nature as that I should be deceived, even respecting the matters that appeared to me the most evidently true… that I may be able wholly to remove [this doubt] I must inquire whether there is a God… I must examine likewise whether [God] can be a deceiver.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="how" class="slide level2">
<h1>How?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>There is still another way of inquiring whether, of the objects whose ideas are in my mind, there are any that exist outside of me.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Then things get weird.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Basic idea:</p>
<p>Some ideas have more <strong>Objective Reality</strong> than others. Idea of God has maximal objective reality.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>What could that mean?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“participate by representation in higher degrees of being or perfection”</p>
</blockquote>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Is there a difference between the idea of a more perfect thing, and the idea of a less perfect thing?</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Maybe… Most traits don’t transfer to ideas (idea of a dog is not a dog, it’s an idea), but some do.</p>
</div>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Memory of beautiful music might be beautiful. Idea of a complex machine might be complex. Perception of a signal carrying information carries information.</p>
</div>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Other analogies?</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<blockquote>
<p>It is manifest by the natural light that there must be at least as much reality in the efficient and total cause as in its effect</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="fragment">
<p>Is it?</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>It is conceivable that we could get other thoughts by recombination of ideas of ourself, of extension, and of God.</p>
<div class="fragment">
<p>But what about the idea of God?</p>
</div>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<blockquote>
<p>By the name God, I understand a substance infinite, eternal, immutable, independent, all-knowing, all-powerful, and by which I myself and every other thing… exists… these properties are so great and excellent, that the more attentively I consider them the less I feel persuaded that the idea I have of them owes its origin to myself alone… [So] God exists… I should not… have the idea of an infinite substance, … unless it were given to me by some being in reality infinite.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="objections" class="slide level2">
<h1>Objections</h1>
<ol type="1">
<li>Is infinity an idea we arrive at by negation?</li>
</ol>
<div class="fragment">
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li>Is it an idea we arrive at by accumulation?</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="fragment">
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li>Is it a confused or obscure idea that originates from our imperfection?</li>

<section><section id="descartes-cosmological-argument" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>Descartes’ Cosmological Argument</h1></section><section id="section" class="slide level2">
<h1></h1>
<blockquote>
<p>from whom could I… derive my existence?… If I were myself the author of my being, I should doubt of nothing, I should desire nothing…. for I should have bestowed upon myself every perfection of which I possess the idea</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section id="derived-existence" class="slide level2">
<h1>Derived existence</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>[Even if my origin can be explained, or needs no explanation] I should not, on this ground, escape the force of these reasonings… for the whole time of my life can be divided into an infinity of parts, each of which is in no way dependent on any other; and, accordingly, because I was in existence a short time ago, it does not follow that I must now exist, unless in this moment some cause create me anew… that is, conserve me.</p>
</blockquote>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<p>Could something other than God be responsible for my continued existence? No—because there must be as much reality in the cause as the effect, and I possess the idea of God.</p>
</section></section>
<section><section id="god-is-no-deceiver" class="titleslide slide level1"><h1>God is no deceiver</h1></section><section id="whence-the-idea" class="slide level2">
<h1>Whence the idea?</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I have not drawn it from the senses, nor is it even presented to me unexpectedly, as is usual with the ideas of sensible objects… it is not even a pure production or fiction of my mind, for it is not in my power to take from it or add to it; consequently, there remains the alternative that it is innate, in the same way as the idea of myself</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Analogy to a signature.</p>
</section><section class="slide level2">

<blockquote>
<p>God cannot be a deceiver, since it is a dictate of natural reason that all fraud and deception spring from some defect.</p>
